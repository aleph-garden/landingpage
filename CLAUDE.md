# Development workflow

**Vibe-code style**: Work on one thing at a time with quick iterations. Keep responses
concise and focused. Only use brainstorming when explicitly needed or when starting
significant new features. Default to direct implementation for small tasks.

**Commits**: Always reference `.conventional-commits.md` to determine the correct format
and type for commit messages. Follow the specification exactly. Keep commit messages
concise - use a brief subject line (max 72 chars) and only add body text if necessary.
